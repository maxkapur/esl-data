# esl-data

I used my spare time during my Fulbright grant to teach myself statistics and Python. In this essay, I explain rudimentary data analysis techniques that ELL teachers can use to better understand their students. I also compute the perfect classroom temperature.Presented at Fulbright Koreaâ€™s fall conference, Gyeongju, October 2019.
